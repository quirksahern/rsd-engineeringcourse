    "CSV, JSON and YAML are very common formats for representing general-purpose data, but their simplicity sometimes makes then inconvenient for scientific applications. A common drawback, for example, is that reading very large amounts of data from a CSV or JSON file can be inefficient. This has led to to the use of more targeted file formats which better address scientists' requirements for storing, accessing or manipulating data.\n",

    "\n",
    "HDF5 is the current version of the [Hierachical Data Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format) (HDF), and is commonly used to store large volumes of scientific data, such as experimental results or measurements. An HDF5 file contains two kinds of entities organised in a hierarchy, similar to a filesystem.\n",

    "- **Datasets** contain scalar or array values. Each dataset has a type, such as integer, floating-point or string.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Groups** contain datasets or other groups, much like directories contain files and directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both datasets and groups can have **attributes** associated with them, which provide metadata about the contents.\n",

    "We will store the locations of our sampling points in a dataset called `locations`, and the actual results in a group called `measurements`. Within that group, we will have a dataset for each date we took samples on, which will contain results for all locations on that date. For instance, if we are collecting data from $N$ locations at $T$ times per day, each dataset will be a $N \\times T$ array of numerical values (integer or floating-point, depending on how we want to record it).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the strengths of the HDF5 format is that a file can contain disparate kinds of data, of arbitrary size and types. The attributes provide additional information about the meaning or provenance of the data, and can even link to other datasets and groups within the file."

    "#### Working with HDF5 files\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike CSV or JSON files, which contain plain text, HDF5 is a **binary file** format. This means that the information stored there is encoded in a more complex way, and cannot be shown or edited using a simple text editor. Instead, to inspect the contents of an HDF5 file, we must use a more specialised application which \"knows\" how to to read the encoded information. One such application is [HDFView](https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdfview/).\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative is to interact with files **programmatically** - that is, use some code to read or write HDF5 files. Doing this from scratch would be tricky, but there are various libraries that let you interact with an HDF5 file from within your program. You can see [examples of basic tasks](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/Examples+from+Learning+the+Basics) in various programming languages, including Python, in the documentation pages of the HDF5 standard."
